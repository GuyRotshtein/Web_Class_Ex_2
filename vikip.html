<p><b><i>Earth</i></b> is the third planet from the Sun, &nbsp;&nbsp; and the only place known in the universe where life has originated and found habitability.
    While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water,
    extending over 70.8% of the Earth with its ocean, making Earth an ocean world.
    Earth's polar regions currently retain most of all other water with large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater,
    lakes, rivers and atmospheric water. Land, consisting of continents and islands, extends over 29.2% of the Earth and is widely covered by vegetation.
    Below Earth's surface material lies Earth's crust consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges,
    volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes the magnetosphere of Earth, largely deflecting
    destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.</p>
